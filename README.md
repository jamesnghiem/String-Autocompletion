# String-Autocompletion

String-Autocompletion returns the highest-priority string matching a given substring. Based on autocompletion implementations on Google.com, Yahoo.com, etc, this project aims to replicate string completion based on weight values of certain search terms.

I completed this with Edward Sa and Leon Kwak in Summer 2017 for a Data Structures course at Berkeley.
